1. Yes, the type of type required for a match is onyl specified to be IContestant, not that the contests are the same type.
2. This is allowed because Match uses generic interface "IContestant" and "IResult" do not specify that the classes need to be the same derived type.  
3. This could be prevented by creating a more derived version of match for each
event that uses different parameters. For example, a type "RugbyMatch" would only take in rugby teams and rugby
results as parameters rather than the more generic IContestant and IResult.
