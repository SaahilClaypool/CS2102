1. Someone could place different sporting event teams together. A match does not specify the type of contestant or score
2. This is allowed because Match uses generic interface "IContestant" and "IResult" do not specify that the classes need to be the same derived type.  
3. This could be prevented by creating a more derived version of match for each
event that uses different parameters. For example, a type "RugbyMatch" would only take in rugby teams and rugby
results as parameters rather than the more generic IContestant and IResult.
